## Project Overview
In this project, I collaborated with four data scientists to develop a transaction fraud detector, reducing operational costs and safeguarding the partner bank's reputation.
### Major Components of the Project:
- **Data size** : 1.5 million
- **Data Preprocessing and EDA**: Investigated and disputed missing, analyzed geo location, time-series and individual customer behavior, checked outliers. Developed python modules for feature engineering pipeline (e.g., velocity, frequency, feature crossing).
- **Modeling**: Addressed imbalanced data, and built binary classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), achieving a ROC-AUC of 0.89.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the model as a dashboard on AWS for internal use, enhancing the partner bank's ability to predict and manage fraud risk.
## Dashboard
- Using part of the fraud transaction data for creating plots
- Using SQL server for data preprocessing
- Using Power BI for data visualization and dashboarding
